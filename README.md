# WithinTheConsole
Welcome to my biggest project so far, Within The Console! This was a text-based game I was making for fun, heavily shaped after the indie video game [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/](Inscryption). I decided to try and finish it for my AP Computer Science class as a final project for the year.
